description: 'Much of sensory neuroscience has focused on how the brain faithfully
  represents sensory information. However, sensory information is often incomplete
  and ambiguous. Hence, the brain must rely on an internal model of the sensory world
  to infer a coherent percept. Illusions reveal rational mistakes in perceptual inference,
  yielding unique insights into the brainâ€™s internal model. Here, we utilized illusory
  contours (ICs) to study the microcircuit mechanisms underlying the perceptual inference
  of an edge. Evidence for IC perception has been shown in multiple species, including
  mice. Neural correlates of IC perception have also been identified, i.e., neurons
  that respond to ICs with the same receptive field and feature selectivity (e.g.,
  orientation tuning) as for real edges, despite the lack of feedforward sensory drive.
  Our goal was to investigate how neocortical microcircuits give rise to illusory
  responses in IC encoders. In addition, we aimed to investigate whether the microcircuit
  implementation of IC encoding is common across the visual cortex hierarchy.
